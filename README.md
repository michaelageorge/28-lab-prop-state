### Description
* This is a lab designed to teach us how to modularize React applications. 

* In the 'Non-Modularized' files, all of the code is written in an index.js file. They work and function how we want them to, but the singular index.js file doesn't use the part of React that React is really good at, and that is great modularization. 

* In the 'Modularized' files, all of the code from the 'Non-Modularized' file has been properly modularized. It functions the same, and each part of the 'Non-Modularized' file has been broken down into much smaller components.
